        I am a Front-End React Developer with an artistic eye and knack for
        aesthetics. My interests include Googling emerging technologies, sifting
        through color schemes and typography best suited for the software I'm
        designing, and sharing Tech Tea with friends. I am heavy on the “I may
        not have done that before, but I can give any idea life with some HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript.” I genuinely enjoy when my plans leap from the
        wireframe onto a well-polished interface.

        If I'm not coding, you can find me loudly laughing, cooking to end world
        hunger, supporting small businesses, clanking margarita glasses with my
        husband, or chasing my two-year-old. And sometimes all of the above,
        simultaneously.
